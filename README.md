# area-of-triangle
This program, developed in C++, is a calculator that determines the area and semiperimter of a triangle with side lengths of a, b, c.

The user can continue calculating the areas and semiperimeters as many times as they would like. If the user enters invalid lengths, the calculator lets the user know by printing a message stating that the lengths are invalid, and then prompts the user if he/she would like to continue computing area and semiperimeters. 

The output is printed onto the screen after each calculation.
